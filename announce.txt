Subject: libXpm-noX 3.5.12-1

The following packages have been uploaded to the Cygwin distribution:

* libXpm-noX-3.5.12-1
* libXpm-noX-devel-3.5.12-1
* libXpm-noX_4-3.5.12-1

libXpm-noX is a version of the X.Org X Pixmap library that does not
require an X server and provides none of the X-based display routines.
It provides tools and libraries for manipulating XPM images.  It is
useful if you have an application that needs to read and write Xpm
format files, but either does not display them or handles display
itself, without accessing X11 services.

This is an update to the latest upstream release.
